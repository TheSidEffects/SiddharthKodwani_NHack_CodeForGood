Topic: Economic Empowerment
To empower the economy of India, we need to turn ourselves to the untouched side, Tourism.
While India is called 'God's own country', or as we all know, India has given birth to great epics like Ramayana, we, Indians are not taking advantage of this country. If Indians unite and implement proper tourism in the country, it's economy could thrive to beat's US's in the blink of an eye.

Our project focuses on providing 2 major luxuries to a foreginer travelling to India:
1. AI TourPlanner: This AI plans a tour for the user according to their interests, and promotes weaker(economically) and unexplored states like Bihar and UP. This is required as India a huge country with great diversity. This allows the user to explore india according to their interest.

2. WanderIndiaGPT: This chatbot answers all the questions of a tourist, from a good place to eat at night to finding Buddha temples near me. This lightning innovation helps the tourist explore India without thinking of a lanugage barrier, and adds simplicity to visiting a India, like no other country.
